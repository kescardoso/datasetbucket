![label](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54631569/114139488-bfc68000-992c-11eb-9b11-28084dd9b8bc.png)

## About

Dataset Bucket üìà is a python-flask web application build upon a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) database system to generate, store and display dataset structures.

It's a machine learning bias auditor. Built with [Python-Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) and the [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).

You will be able to find and read reports from a **wiki styled list** of information about data containing _population_ and _demographic_ subjects.

## Motivation

The whole world is data-driven, but we are still not sure if the data used in testing the machine learning models are biased to one thing, person, or group. If this is the case the chances are extremely high that the model doesn't yield accurate results. 

To overcome this issue, we came up with an idea to create a web app that tells you if the dataset you are using is biased or not, and also suggests possible changes you can make to improve the quality of your analysis. üìä


## Technologies and Frameworks Used

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)

##### We used a lot of python libraries for building this project. Know more about them from [LIBRARIES.md]().

## App Walkthrough

###### 1. OPEN THE APP
[Head on to our app deployed on Heroku.](https://datasetbucket.herokuapp.com/)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54631569/114146731-9100d780-9935-11eb-9700-52d6ed2ccbdb.png)

You will see a **WELCOME** screen, it has the same basic instructions to get started and what you can expect from the app.

###### 2. DATATAGS

In the **data tags** tab, you can find various tags associated with the reports uploaded on the app.

By clicking the **view** button on any of the available tags, you can see the dataset, analytical reports, and other information about the TAG.

###### 3. DATASETS

The **datasets** tab has the list of all the datasets, to which an analytical report was generated. It is presented in the form of an accordion collapsable styled list, so you can click on any dataset you wish to explore and all the information related to that particular dataset will be displayed.

You can view the author, the development status, tags associated, and an option to download the analytical report. 

###### 4. REGISTER / LOG IN

Using the **register** tab you will land on the registration page, where you can create an account on this app.

If you are already a user of our app, head on the **log in** page.

üíü _By being a registered user of our app, you will have access to upload new datasets to the app and generate reports for those._

###### 5. ANALYSE

_After logging into the app_ go to the * analyze* tab. You will see a menu to `enter the kaggle URL`. After adding a valid Kaggle dataset URL. Click on `GET ANALYSIS REPORT`.

You will see a progress bar till the report gets generated. Once it stops, the report gets downloaded automatically by the name of `report.pdf`.

It would have all the details related to your dataset and what all improvements are possible.

# üì© Project Installation and Local Deployment


## Prerequisites

 Install [python3 and pip3](https://www.python.org) in your machine

 Create an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)


## Installation
    
1. Download or clone [this project](https://github.com/kescardoso/datasetbucket) into your local workspace

2. Create a virtual environment using the command: `Python3 -m venv venv`

    _After running this command, the folders will be automatically set up on your workspace._

3. Activate your python interpretor using the command: 
    
    `source venv/bin/activate` : mac
    
    `.\venv\Scripts\activate` : windows

4. Install [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) using the command:
    
    `pip install Flask`

    and all the required dependencies with: 

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Local Deployment

1. Create an `env.py` file to keep your sensitive data secret.

2. Open `env.py` and enter the following:

    ```python
    import os

    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "secret_key_here")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "value_from mongoDB_here")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "value_from mongoDB_here")
    ```

3. Wire up [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

    [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) allows the developer to download datasets directly from the terminal.

    1. Make sure you have a [kaggle account](https://kaggle.com)

    2. Follow these steps to download `kaggle.json` files, which helps to run the API:
        
        - Go to the **Account** tab in your Kaggle profile and scroll to the **API** section. 
        
        - Click **Create new API Token**. This will download the `kaggle.json` file, add it to the `/.kaggle` path.

        _For more complete and detailed instructions on how to use the Kaggle API, visit [Kaggle's documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication)._

    3. Wire up MongoDB and its functionalities with Flask, by installing `flask-pymongo` and `dnspython`. Use:

        `pip3 install flask-pymongo`

        `pip3 install dnspython`
    
    
    4. Run the `app.py` in debug mode as a flask application or use the following command: 

        `pyhon3 -m flask run`
    
        to see the project in your locally deployed `http` address.

    5. You may need to install the following packages to enable all the commands and functionalities:

        `pip3 install reportlab`

        `pip3 install statistics`

        `pip3 install sklearn`

    

## Heroku Deployment

1. Fulfil all Heroku requirements by chequing and freezing your dependencies and by creating a Procfile:

    You can run these two commands to fulfill the purpose:

    `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

    `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

    **Commit and push your changes.**

2. Create a new app from your [Heroku dashboard](https://www.heroku.com/).

3. Add your environmental variables to Heroku, by going to **Settings**, and then to **Config Vars**, and enter the sensitive information from your MongoDB and your `env.py` file:

    `import os`

    `os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your_secret_key_here")`

    `os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "value_from mongoDB_here")`

    `os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "value_from mongoDB_here")`

4. From your Heroku dashboard, wire up your Heroku app to your git repository, by going to:

    - **Deploy** > **Deployment Method** > click: **Connect to GitHub**

    - Search your repo from the dropdown, and connect

    - Choose a branch to deploy your changes

    - Deploy your branch and view the app
